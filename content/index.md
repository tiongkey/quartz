title: A Fraction of My Second Brain

## Intro

I'm Gio. This is where I dump some of my best thinking in the form of notes.

The habit of notetaking is probably the most impactful thing I got from school. I was using pen and paper then like any other 90s kid - and then smartphones happened. Like many people, I got introduced to digital notes through the Evernote app. I remember using that on my HTC Desire Z, typing away random ideas and thoughts.

Anyways, the plan is to eventually pass my notes down to my kids.
