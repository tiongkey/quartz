title: Piece of Mind
---

I'm Gio. I started writing notes to help me think. Storing ideas and things I've been learning & doing is my bag of tricks. It gives me a sense comfort. Control.

Then I realized that, hey -- If I store enough of the good stuff, the things that truly matter, the learnings and values that lead to a good life ... I can pass it all down to my kids in the future. My mind as an heirloom ðŸ˜„

But that'll be my very *very* personal notes. On this site I'll mostly just share what I've been working on and thinking about (that can't fit in a tweet)

## Getting around
This site is what's called a [[digital garden]], a way of publishing personal knowledge that's constantly evolving. Read more about it [[digital garden|here]] if you want. 

**The gist:** you'll see a lot of links; just tap/click it if it's interesting. Look at my Recent Notes for a stream of content that's always showing the most recently modified at the top.
